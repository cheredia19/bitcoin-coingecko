What a rollercoaster for Bitcoin! From its [initial monetary value](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-history-chart/#:~:text=What%20Price%20Did%20Bitcoin%20Start,a%20value%20of%20%240.0009%20each.) [to the guy who paid two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins on May 22, 2010](https://news.bitcoin.com/14-years-ago-an-individual-offered-10000-bitcoins-for-2-pizzas-finalizing-the-deal-in-4-days/), to the current price, much water has passed under the bridge.

From an initial estimated value of 0.0009, Bitcoin wasn't even worth a buck until February, 2011. Months later, its cotization began to scale. It reached 30 dollars for the first time in July but dropped to 2 dollars just six months later.

In 2012, Bitcoin broke the 100-dollar barrier for the first time on April 11, and in 2013, the 1,000-dollar barrier, however rapidly fell to 559.36 dollars on December 17.

2014 was not a good year, despite reaching a maximum of 936.4 dollars on January 5. It ended that year at 314 dollars, a value loss of two-thirds.

## What happened next?

Coingecko, the world's largest independent aggregator of cryptocurrency data, has historical Bitcoin price data public since January 1, 2015. The following table shows the daily price from that date through June 30, 2024. That's nine and a half years or, looked at another way, 114 months, or 3,468 days of Bitcoin prices at our disposal to perform the most interesting analyses.

In that span, Bitcoin went from the lowest price (172 dollars on January 14, 2015) to 73,098 dollars (on March 14, 2024), the highest value reached until now. How many dollars would represent that day the two pizzas bought in 2010 for 10,000 bitcoins? A hint: it's **a number of nine figures**!
