What a rollercoaster has been the Bitcoin! From its [initial monetary value](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-history-chart/#:~:text=What%20Price%20Did%20Bitcoin%20Start,a%20value%20of%20%240.0009%20each.) [to the guy who paid two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins on May 22, 2010](https://news.bitcoin.com/14-years-ago-an-individual-offered-10000-bitcoins-for-2-pizzas-finalizing-the-deal-in-4-days/), to the current price, much water has passed under the bridge.

From an initial estimated value of 0.0009, Bitcoin wasn't even worth a buck until February, 2011. Months later, its cotization began to scale. It reached 30 dollars for the first time in July but dropped to 2 dollars just six months later.

In 2012, Bitcoin broke the 100-dollar barrier for the first time on April 11, and in 2013, the 1,000-dollar barrier, however rapidly fell to 559.36 dollars on December 17.

2014 was not a good year, despite reaching a maximum of 936.4 dollars on January 5. It ended that year at 314 dollars, a value loss of two-thirds.
